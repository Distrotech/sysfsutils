1. Introduction
---------------

This package's purpose is to provide a set of utilities for interfacing
with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that
provides a tree of system devices. While a filesystem is a very useful
interface, we've decided to provide a stable programming interface
that will hopefully make it easier for applications to query system devices
and their attributes.

This package currently includes:

- libsysfs: a library for accessing system devices.
- systool: an application to view system device information by bus, class,
	and topology.
- A number of example usage routines in the "test" directory.
- A comprehensive testsuite, also shipped as part of the "test" directory. This
	testsuite can be used to test _all_ the APIs exported by Libsysfs.
	Please refer the libsysfs.txt file in the "docs" directory for
	details as to how to use the testsuite.


2. How to Install
-----------------

Run the "configure" script to generate Makefiles. Use "make" to build the
library and utilities.

For a successful install, run "make install" as super-user. "make uninstall"
will clean up all installed files.

If needed, to regenerate the configure script and the Makefiles, you may
need to run automake, autoconf, and autoheader. If the version of automake
has changed significantly, you may have re-run aclocal to recreate aclocal.m4.
